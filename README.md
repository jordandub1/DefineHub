# DefineHub

DefineHub is going to be a website based off of an in-depth explanation of the word of your choosing. Ex: definition, synonyms, pronunciation, origin, and more detailed information about the word. DefineHub will allow you to pick a word of any language and it will display all information about said word. This will use the WordAPI to obtain the dictionary information of the word. Involved will be the youtubeAPI to show a list of videos pulled from youtube on how to properly pronounce the word you choose. as an extra we are wanting to include a mapAPI to show where the word has originated from IF that information is accessible.
